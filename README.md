This is an assignment for the course "HTML, CSS, Javascript & Webbstandarder" (YHJUST).
My solution is an Advent Calendar, ie a 24-day calendar that has 24 items that can be opened individually to reveal a daily surprise in the form of a lovely baby picture. 

Features:
- Randomized calendar: The 24 items are randomized and added to a bootstrap grid
- Nice clean calendar UI
- User can only open items that correspond to todays date or earlier - it is not possible to open items corresponding to future dates.
- Bootstrap & jQuery used to build this.
